Referee report on "DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF REIONIZATION IN LARGE
COSMOLOGICAL VOLUMES I: NUMERICAL METHODS AND TESTS" by M.L. Norman et
al.

This is an interesting, if by nature fairly technical paper on the
methodology used in a recently developed radiative-hydrodynamics
module in the Enzo code and the tests this has been put through for
verification purposes. I think the paper should be published
eventually, but there are some corrections and clarifications which
will need to be done first, as outlined below, roughly in order of
appearance in the paper: 

1) The introduction needs significant additional work - currently
there are a number of incorrect or misleading statements, missing or
incorrect references, all of which should be fixed, specified roughly
in order of appearance in the text: 

- The paper title is misleading - 20 Mpc comoving volume (~14 Mpc/h?)
  is not really a large cosmological volume by any standard. This is
  one of the larger fully coupled radiative-hydrodynamics reionization
  simulations, but given that the typical reionization simulation
  volume is ~100 Mpc/h, the one presented here is actually rather
  small. This is important since it can lead to systematic issues,
  given that the typical sizes of ionized patches during reionization
  can be as large or larger than the full volume studied here. It is
  also somewhat unclear what 'direct simulation' means, fully coupled,
  or what? I don't think there are any 'indirect' simulations, so this
  is a somewhat puzzling terminology. 

- The paper abstract mentions an earlier Reynolds et al. paper, but
  with no proper reference. This should be fixed, esp. given that
  there are two 'Reynolds at al.' papers in the bibliography.

  DR -- this has been fixed.

- Pars. 1 and 2 of Intro - Trac and Gnedin 2011 is a review paper and
  does not really have anything to do with deriving the CMB
  constraints on the reionization redshift (paragraph 1) or the
  quasars not contributing substantially to reionization (paragraph 2)
  - for both only relevant references should be given, preferably the
  first and/or most up-to-date constraints. 

- Par. 6 of Intro: The reionization simulations cited there (Iliev et
  al. 2006, Trac and Cen 2007, etc.) are all quite old by now and were
  all done with particle-mesh codes, which of course have low force
  resolution. However, more recent simulations are typically far
  better resolved than that, using either P3M (e.g. Iliev et al. 2012,
  MNRAS, 423, 2222) or tree methods (e.g. Pawlik and Schaye 2011,
  MNRAS, 412, 1943; Petkova and Springel 2011, MNRAS, 415, 3731),
  which typically give 1-2 kpc/h or better force resolution, far
  higher than the 25 kpc one used here. Similarly, there exist already
  radiative transfer simulations with better resolution than the
  quoted 250-500 kpc/h.  Furthermore, it is not strictly correct that
  coarse-grained radiative transfer necessarily does not take into
  account hydrodynamics effects. More specifically, all above methods,
  and others, take into account the effect of radiation on the local
  star formation, resulting e.g. in suppression of low-mass sources. 

- Par. 7 of Intro: the 11,560^3 resolution mentioned for Trac, Cen and
  Loeb (2008) is misleading - these are grid cells, not
  particles. Photoevaporation of gas from halos was done by Shapiro et
  al. 2004 well before Whalen et al. 2008.

- Par. 9 of Intro: the discussion of scaling of radiative transfer
  methods is rather incomplete. Many methods do not scale at all with
  the number of sources, others alleviate this scaling by using
  adaptive rays, short characteristics ray tracing or other
  techniques. 

2) Mathematical formulation section:

- Par. 2: While I agree that shadows themselves are rarely, if ever,
  important in cosmological simulations, the gas dynamics can change
  very considerably between one-sided irradiation and uniform one from
  all sides.  The FLD method therefore should be very carefully tested
  in each particular setup to make sure this does not affect the
  results. I am quite puzzled by the statement that the typical
  reionization simulations are in the 'low-opacity limit' - low
  compared to what? The opacity of fully neutral gas is quite large
  (which is why we need radiative transfer in the first place?).

  DR -- I've modified the 'low-opacity limit' statement to indicate
  that this is important in later stages of reionization simulations.
  Perhaps Mike should see if this should be revised in some other
  manner? 

- It is not very clear to me what is the point of using detailed SED
  models in combination with grey radiative transfer, given that the
  latter gives quite unrealistic frequency dependence. 

- Sect. 3.3: statements like 'results that are accurate enough' do not
  really mean anything. This needs to be specified properly - is it
  10%, 1%, 10^-8 or what? There are more than one such statements in
  the paper. 

  DR -- I have made this more precise, though since I was just trying
  to describe Enzo's old solver, which itself uses highly questionable
  numerical methods, it is difficult to really state a value with
  certainty.  I said that Enzo's existing solver is accurate to within
  10%, which is likely correct since it limits the subcycled time step
  size to ensure relative change below that amount.

- Tests:

  - General comment - most figure labels are quite small and difficult
    to read, please fix.

    DR -- I've updated all of the figures that I created to enlarge
    the labels.  I do not have the sources for Robert's or Geoffrey's
    figures.

  - Sect. 4.1.1 - is this the same as Test 1 in Iliev et al. 2006? If
    yes, say so, if not, why not and what is different? Doing the
    exact same test will make comparisons with other codes easier.

    DR -- I've updated the problem description to clarify this.

    - The HI ionization threshold is 13.6 eV, not 13.5.

      DR -- Typo, sorry.  It is now fixed.

    - what is 'time tolerances', please define.
  
      DR -- This is just due to changing terminology within the
      results section.  I've udpated all 'tolerance' references to
      specify that they refer to the time step tolerance, and I've
      updated the introduction of that value to more clearly specify
      how it is used. 

    - the error of the I-front position in equ. 20 is a rather strange
      way to do this, a position-by-position error will be much more 
      informative.
 
      DR -- I have no idea what he's talking about.  For each run, we
      have the I-front position as a function of time.  In order to
      show a convergence plot, I need a single number for each
      tolerance value.  Mike, do you know what he means, or should we
      just reply with my explanation and ask for clarification if that
      is not enough? 

    - the tolerance 'sweet spot' discussed at the end of sect. 4.1.1
      could be problem-dependent.

      DR -- I've updated the text to state this fact, and explained
      that we use this value as a starting point for other
      simulations. 

  - sect. 4.1.2: the ionization front in a cosmologically expanding 
    medium is a nice, but not a particularly demanding test. More
    interesting and difficult tests (but still with an exact solution)
    are e.g. expansion from the center of 1/r density profile or 1/r^2
    density profile with a flat core (see Mellema et al. 2006; Iliev
    et al. 2006). More generally, why only some of the tests from the
    Iliev et al. 2006 comparison project were done here?  How were
    those picked? It would also be useful to compare the results
    obtained here with those from other codes (available at the code
    comparison website). Currently only some of the Wise & Abel code
    tests are compared, and even those only very qualitatively, rather
    than quantitatively, by e.g. plotting them against each other.

    DR -- It sounds like he wants us to run every Iliev test and every
    Wise & Abel test using every solver on the code comparison site,
    and to then overlay plots.  This is insane.  If necessary, I can
    run the 1/r or 1/r^2 test as well, though given the difficulties
    we'd had with some of the other comparison tests I can't say how
    long this will take.  

  - sect. 4.2.2 (Test 7), last paragraph: comparison with WA11 is
    again done very qualitatively, so it is not clear if the two
    really agree well. Please show something more quantitative - like
    the ionized fraction vs. time, or histograms of the ionization and
    temperature distributions.  

    DR -- These plots are already provided in Figure 8!!  The reviewer
    needs to read more carefully.

  - sect. 4.3 : the test used to show the parallel scalability of the
    code is absolutely inadequate for the purpose. Solving 64^3 times
    exactly the same problem on each MPI node naturally results in a
    perfect work balance, but basically tells us nothing at all about
    the code scalability because production runs are nothing like that
    well balanced, and (if I understand the setup correctly, the
    explanations are rather short) there is no interaction or
    communication between sub-domains. If the authors would like to
    show code scalability this should be done properly, or otherwise
    this section should be dropped. 

    DR -- The reviewer does not know what he's talking about.  While
    his statement might be true for a ray-tracing solver, or in fact
    any solver that uses explicit updates and/or point-to-point
    communication to handle interactions between subdomains, he is
    completely incorrect for field-based solvers.  At every time step
    I solve the fully-coupled linear system over the entire domain,
    which involves both point-to-point communication of subdomain
    boundaries at all levels of the multigrid hierarchy, and
    all-to-all communication of dot products.  This FLD solver
    therefore inherently couples every subdomain together in every
    time step, and the fact that we don't see photon fluxes cross
    subdomain boundaries is completely irrelevant, 

  - sect. 5: why is the Eisenstein and Hu transfer function used for
    the example simulations? It is quite old by now and not really
    very accurate.  I am also wondering if the gasdynamics really has
    much effect here, given that the spatial resolution is quite
    coarse and those effects mostly show up at smaller scales. 

  - end of Sect 5: the Iliev et al. 2006 and Trac and Cen 2007 are
    both quite old simulations (and at a different scale), so probably
    are not the best base for comparison here - more up-to-date
    simulations could be more appropriate.

- Conclusions: The effect of shadows (3rd par.) is likely not
  important in cosmological situations, but this is not really shown
  conclusively here, so should not be claimed. The code scalability
  (par. 7) is not shown at present, as was discussed above. This
  requires a proper scalability test. 

- references: need work - some are missing, most ArXiv papers have no
  numbers, etc.
